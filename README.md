# breast-cancer-classification

This project is a simple classification of breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Gene Expression Profiles (METABRIC) dataset. The dataset is available on kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric).

The dataset contains 1904 samples and 693 features.

The goal is to further learn about machine learning and data science by applying the knowledge to a real-world dataset.
